# ISFPLOT

This is a simple application for processing ISF binary files generated by Tektronix MDO and MSO series oscilloscopes. The application allows the user to browse and open ISF or CSV files and display their plots. The application also allows users to save the data from an opened ISF file as a CSV file, and to display the information contained in an ISF file. GUI made with Tkinter.

## How to use
* Clone the repository or download executable from `dist`.
* Run the executable file.
* Click on the "Browse Files" button to select an ISF or CSV file.
* Once the file is selected, the filename will be displayed on the screen.
* Depending on the type of file selected, some buttons may be disabled.
* Click on the "Show plot" button to display the plot of the data contained in the file.
* Click on the "Show info" button to display the information contained in the ISF file.
* Click on the "Save as CSV" button to save the data contained in an ISF file as a CSV file.

## Executable
Windows executable build with `pyinstaller`:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=favicon.ico .\ISFPLOT.py
```

## Note
* The application may not work properly with some ISF or CSV files.
* Only one channel is processed right now.
