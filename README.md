# ISFPLOT

Very simple application with a purpose of processing ISF binary files generated by Tektronix MDO and MSO series oscilloscopes. 
For now it can make a plot (from ISF and CSV) and write data as CSV, but for one channel only. GUI made with Tkinter.

*Special thanks to Konstantin Shpakov for [ISF reader](https://github.com/shpakovkv/isf-converter-py).*

Windows executable build with pyinstaller:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=favicon.ico .\ISFPLOT.py
```
